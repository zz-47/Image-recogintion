# Image Recognition

## Overview
The `Image-recognition` repository is focused on building computer vision models using deep learning techniques to classify, detect, and segment images. It includes various models built using libraries like `TensorFlow` and `OpenCV` for image processing.

## Dependencies
- `opencv-python`: For image manipulation and pre-processing.
- `tensorflow`: For deep learning models and neural networks.
- `numpy`: For numerical computations and handling image data.
- `matplotlib`: For plotting image results.

Install dependencies using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
